# SSG

this is a monorepo for a Sapper Site Generator and related packages. Check README's inside `/packages` for more info on each. In particular:

- [/packages/ssg](/packages/ssg/README.md) is the primary package
- [/packages/source-yaml](/packages/source-yaml/README.md) (status: inactive, but usable)
- [/packages/source-remark](/packages/source-remark/README.md) (status: active)

We also have an `examples` folder but its kinda inactive right now.
